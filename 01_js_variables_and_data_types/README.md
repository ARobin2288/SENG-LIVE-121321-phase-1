# Lecture 1 - JS Variables & Data Types

## Learning Goals

- âœ… Utilize console.log() for testing
- âœ… Identify JS data types
- âœ… Define variables using let vs const
- âœ… Practice conditional statements

## Warm Up Question

ðŸ’¡ Why do we use data types in JavaScript, and what do they help us to accomplish as developers?

## Follow Ups

ðŸ’¡ If we were building a Music Library application, where we can add songs to our library and play them, what information might we want to keep track of? What data types would we use?


ðŸ’¡ If we were building a Todo List  application, where we can add tasks to our todo list and mark them as complete, what information might we want to keep track of? What data types would we use?

What to look out for:
